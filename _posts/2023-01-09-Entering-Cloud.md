I entered the cloud ecosystem with little to no prior experience.

At the time, learning on the job felt normal. Today, cloud technologies are central to most software systems, and expectations have shifted. Developers are often expected to arrive with a baseline understanding of cloud concepts rather than starting from zero.

In this post, I want to share why preparing before entering the cloud matters more today, and how certifications can help provide structure—without being a substitute for real experience.
