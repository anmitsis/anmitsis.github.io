Hello, I am Antonis, and this site is the product of me failing to sit around during my days-off. 

I am a graduate of the [Applied Mathematics & Physical Sciences](https://semfe.ntua.gr/el/) from NTUA and I currently work as a AI/ML Python Developer or maybe Data Engineer that also likes Data Science.

Facts (100% truth) about me:
- I say thank you to AI so it knows i was raised right.
- I dont know what to write here but i wanted to have a blog.
- I kind of watch too much anime.
